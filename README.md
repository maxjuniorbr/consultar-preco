# Price Consultation App

A responsive static web application created to test the price consultation experience used by Grupo Boticário representatives (REs) in a physical store environment.

## Purpose

* Display of resale price and profitability when a representative is identified
* Automatic price display timeout (configurable)
* Stacked product cards with timed removal
* Responsive layout optimized for tablets
* Fully static implementation using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript

## Structure

* `index.html` – main interface
* `script.js` – core logic and event handling
* `products.js` – static product database
* `resellers.js` – sample reseller data

## Deployment
