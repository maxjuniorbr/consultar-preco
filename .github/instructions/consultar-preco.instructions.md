## Project Context
The project is an **experimental prototype** designed to test a product price-checking feature. It will run on a **tablet with a barcode scanner**, without any database or API integration. The goal is to **evaluate the user experience and interface behavior**, not the system architecture.

## Coding Guidelines

### 1. Structure and Organization
- The code should be structured in **static files**, which may include `HTML`, `CSS`, `JS`, or other files **as needed**.
- All code must be **simple, readable, and modular**.
- Follow **Clean Code** conventions.
- **Avoid redundant or obvious comments.**

### 2. Language and Standards
- **Code and comments must be in English.**
- **UI text** displayed on screen must be in **Brazilian Portuguese**.
- Variable, function, and class names should be **self-explanatory**.
- Use consistent indentation, proper spacing, and semantic HTML best practices.

### 3. Style and Best Practices
- In **HTML**: use semantic tags and clear structure.
- In **CSS**: prefer descriptive class names, avoid unnecessary IDs and repetition.
- In **JavaScript**: follow ES6+ standards, avoid unnecessary imperative code, and prioritize clarity.

### 4. Execution Scope
- The code must **run locally**, without complex external dependencies.
- No database or backend integration is allowed.
- The focus is on **interaction and functionality in a demo environment**.
